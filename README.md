# An Investigation Into Changing Demographics Near Police Stations in San Francisco

This analysis was performed for the [Stanford Future Bay Initiative](http://bay.stanford.edu/education "218X")

Crime in San Francisco has seen a significant rise throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. November 2019 to November 2020 shows a 42% jump in burglaries citywide and 34% uptick in car thefts(1). This coincides with a rise in the homeless population; in 2019 there was an increase of more than 30% over the 2017 count(2). It’s easy to attribute a causal relationship between the two, but that inference may be based more on bias than fact. There are a number of confounding factors that may exacerbate these issues, such as ineffectual policing and increasing home prices. The San Francisco Police budget has steadily increased year over year,(3) yet many of these social inequity problems persist not only in SF but the rest of urban America. These include not only homelessness and crime, but racial profiling by the police, the lack of prosecution for crimes(4) leading to recidivism, and more.

For my project, I will use San Francisco as an example to explore the relationship between police stations and the demographics of residents nearby. Using census data, I can identify the demographic of those that live within a half mile of a police station and perform an equity analysis. My hypothesis is that most police stations are placed in wealthy areas with highly educated people, to provide a sense of security whereas lower income neighborhoods will have less policing and education, which in turn leads to more crime.

In 2014, Californians passed Proposition 47 that reclassified nonviolent theft as misdemeanors as long as the stolen goods are worth less than $950(5). That is just one example of decriminalization in San Francisco, which further supports my hypothesis that policing is meant to protect wealthy individuals and is neglected for lower income areas.

I will then provide a qualitative analysis on whether more or less crime happens in those areas. As stated on sfgov.org, “The Tenderloin Task Force was created on April 1st 1991 (with the first bicycle patrol in the city) to combat the high level of crime in that area and made its headquarters in the basement of the historic Hibernia Bank building. A new headquarters, now formally known as Tenderloin Station, opened in October 2000 at 301 Eddy Street.” The decision to open a police station in this case seems purely motivated by proximity to crime. Analyzing the average income and other predicting factors would inform decisions on where to open new stations in the future. Limitations to this study are any qualitative factors that influence police station construction such as the political landscape at the time, as those cannot be captured in a quantitative analysis. A brief commentary will however be provided on factors to consider and potential biases in addition to a data driven approach.

I will be using ArcGIS Police Station Data, 2020 Decennial Census Data and ACS 2019 5 year data to perform my analysis.
